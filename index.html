				<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/IMG_0226.JPG" alt="photo_of_me">
				<p>Greetings and salutations. Back in 1997 after landing in San Francisco I secured a position as an internet researcher for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB9500455234318488">Scudder Kemper Investments</a>, which was devastatingly boring, however I was given access to a Bloomberg terminal and a <a href="http://disinfo.com/"> corner office </a>, which provided ample time to seek out my next position at <a href="http://listen.com/">Listen.com</a>. Ah the early days of the digital music landscape. What a wild time until of course Napster fucked us all. I stayed with Listen.com until an acquisition by MTV/REAL Networks, which provided a compensation package large enough to focus on my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/11039-KimoSciotic-Records">vinyl record label</a> and time to hold out for my next gig</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>From 2005 until 2009 I was Senior Editor, Project Manager, and eventually interim Product Manger for MP3.com, which after being purchased at a yard sale price from Vivendi was dusted off, semi-revived, and eventually drove into the ground by CNET.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>CNET dissvoled my site in 2009 and after a brief walkabout I became manager of the famed San Francisco book store and cooperative art gallery <a href="http://www.adobebooks.com/">Adobe Books</a>. This lasted until news of my mother's failing health forced my departure from San Francisco back to the desert where I am now reinventing myself via a full stack front-end web development program.</p>
